# FUN-MOOC

This repository is a work-in-progress for the future fun-mooc.fr website. It is
based on [Richie](https://github.com/openfun/richie), a CMS for Open Education.

## Getting started

First, make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop:

```
$ docker -v
  Docker version 1.13.1, build 092cba3

$ docker-compose --version
  docker-compose version 1.17.1, build 6d101fb
```

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use our `Makefile`:

```
$ make bootstrap
```

This command builds the `app` container, starts the service and performs
database migrations. It's a good idea to use this command each time you are
pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or
migration-related issues.

Once the bootstrap phase is finished, you should be able to view the site at
[localhost:8070](http://localhost:8070)

> If you've just bootstrapped this project, you are probably planning to use AWS
> to store and distribute your media and static files. Luckily for you, we've
> cooked `terraform` scripts and a documentation for you! Read more about it:
> [docs/aws.md](./docs/aws.md)

## Usage

### Managing services

If you need to build or rebuild the `app` container, use:

```
$ make build
```

> Note that if the `app` service is already running, you will need to stop it
> first and then restart it to fire up your newly build container.

To start the development stack (_via_ Docker compose), use:

```
$ make run
```

You can inspect logs (in follow mode) with:

```
$ make logs
```

You can stop all services with:

```
$ make stop
```

If you need to stop and remove containers (to drop your database for example),
there is a command for that:

```
$ make down
```

### Housekeeping

Once the CMS is up and running, you can create a superuser account:

```
$ make superuser
```

To perform database migrations, use:

```
$ make migrate
```

You can create a basic demo site by running:

```
$ make demo-site
```

> Note that if you don't create the demo site and start from a blank CMS, you
> will get some errors requesting you to create some required root pages. So it
> is easier as a first approach to test the CMS with the demo site.

### Going further

To see all available commands, run:

```
$ make help
```
